This was an attempted implementation of an RDP library in the D programming
language. It also includes a lot of useful--so I'd like to think--code for
X.224, TPKT, and packets in general. It even has some really generic
interfaces that may be useful for any purpose. I have only abandoned this
because I plan to implement it in Rust instead, which has become my compiled
language of preference.
